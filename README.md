PrimjeriDataGridBundle
=====================

The `PrimjeriDataGridBundle` integrates the [jqgrid](https://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid)
jQuery plugin with Symfony2. This means easy-to-implement datagrids in your Symfony 2 application!

Features include:

- Datagrid supports Doctrine ORM. (For the next version it will support MongoDB, CouchDB).
- Multiple datagrids on a single page
- Searching: You are able to build complex queries with jqgrid query builder
- Filtering using aggregate columns
- Inline data manipulation
- External row manipulation
- Mass actions
- Dependent grids
- Sortable rows
- Highly configurable (It supports most of the jqgrid options)

**Notice:** All PHP code is tested with PHPUnit. To run test 
composer.phar install --dev --prefer-source 
phpunit

**Caution:** This bundle is developed in sync with [symfony's repository](https://github.com/symfony/symfony). 

**Warning:** Not all jqgrid options are supported. DataGrid can be rendered only in Twig environment.
